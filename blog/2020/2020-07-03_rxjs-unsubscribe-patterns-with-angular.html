    <i>A nice pattern for handling unsubscribing from observables in Angular

  <p>
    RxJS Observables are classsss (if you know how to use them) but there
    are quite a few common issues people encounter. If you don't use them
    correctly you can end up with memory leaks. If you don't use them
    efficiently you can end up with a lot of unnecessarily verbose code.
  </p>

  <h2>How to get memory leaks</h2>
  <p>
    In RxJS, each time you <code>subscribe</code> to an <code>Observable</code> or <code>Subject</code> you
    then need to <code>unsubscribe</code>. If you don't <code>unsubscribe</code> the
    <code>subscription</code> will exist in memory and any time the subject emits a
    value, the logic in the subscription will run.
  </p>

  <code class="block javascript">
        <pre>
export class MemoryLeakComponent {

  // Our subject that we will subscribe to
  subjectA$: Subject&lt;number&gt; = new Subject&lt;number&gt;();

  constructor(){
    // Create your memory leaks
    this.subjectA$.subscribe(value => { 
      // logic goes here ...
    });
    this.subjectA$.subscribe(value => {
    // logic goes here ...
    });
    this.subjectA$.subscribe(value => {
    // logic goes here ...
    });
    this.subjectA$.subscribe(value => {
    // logic goes here ...
    });
  }
}
</pre
        >
      </code>

  <p>
    When you navigate away from this component and then navigate back, the
    subscriptions still exist and 4 more subscriptions will be added upon
    each return to this component. If you had, for example, subscribed to a
    <code>Subject</code> from an injected service, the logic in your subscription would
    run in the background any time a value was emitted from the <code>Subject</code>
    even though the instance of the component it was relating to no longer
    exists. This can lead to memory leaks and performance issues. To avoid
    this, you need to <code>unsubscribe</code> which comes with it's own caveats.
  </p>

  <h2>How to end up with unnecessarily verbose code</h2>

  <code class="block javascript">
    <pre>
export class VerboseSubscriptionComponent implements OnDestroy {

  // Our subject that we will subscribe to
  subjectA$: Subject&lt;number&gt; = new Subject&lt;number&gt;();

  // The references we will use for our subscriptions;
  subscriptionA: Subscription;
  subscriptionB: Subscription;
  subscriptionC: Subscription;
  subscriptionD: Subscription;

  constructor(){
    // Create our verbose subscriptions
    this.subscriptionA = this.subjectA$.subscribe(value => { 
      // logic goes here ...
    });
    this.subscriptionB = this.subjectA$.subscribe(value => { 
      // logic goes here ...
    });
    this.subscriptionC = this.subjectA$.subscribe(value => { 
      // logic goes here ...
    });
    this.subscriptionD = this.subjectA$.subscribe(value => { 
      // logic goes here ...
    });
  }

  ngOnDestroy(){
    // Manually unsubscribe from each subscription
    this.subscriptionA.unsubscribe();
    this.subscriptionB.unsubscribe();
    this.subscriptionC.unsubscribe();
    this.subscriptionD.unsubscribe();
  }
}
</pre>
      </code>

  <p>
    This solves the memory leak issue but leaves room for error and is very
    verbose if we have a large amount of subscriptions. If at any point one
    of our <code>subscripton</code> variables is unsubscribed from or if it is never
    actually assigned to, when <code>unsubscribe()</code> is called in <code>ngOnDestroy()</code>
    it will error and break our app.
  </p>

  <p>Below are some solutions that completely avoid this issue.</p>

  <h2>A solution involving (wo)man's best friend; LOOPS!</h2>
  <p>
    We can create an <code>Array&lt;Subscription&gt;</code> to store all our
    subscriptions. Then we itterate over the array in the <code>ngOnDestroy()</code>
    method. With this solution, our code is much less verbose, we don't need
    to worry about keeping track of individual subscriptions and which one
    has or hasn't been unsubscribed from.
  </p>

  <code class="block javascript">
<pre>
export class LoopSubscriptionComponent implements OnDestroy {
  // Our subject that we will subscribe to
  subjectA$: Subject&lt;number&gt; = new Subject&lt;number&gt;();

  // An array to hold our subscriptions
  subscriptions: Array&lt;Subscription&gt; = new Array&lt;Subscription&gt;()

  constructor(){
    // Add our subscription to
    this.subscriptions.push(
      this.subjectA$.subscribe(value => { 
        // logic goes here ...
      })
    );
  }

  ngOnDestroy(){
    // We loop our subscriptions array and unsubscribe
    this.subscriptions.forEach(subscription => subscription.unsubcribe());
  }

}
</pre>
  </code>

  <p>
    This is the solution I used to use when I thought I was really smart and
    cool. I have since been humbled and use the below, superior, solution.
  </p>

  <h2>
    A better solution involving the <code>takeUntil()</code> pipeable operator.
  </h2>

  <p>
    Using the <code>takeUntil()</code> pipeable operator, we no longer need to call <code>unsubscribe()</code>
    on each individual subscription. This operator takes an observable as a
    paramater, and when a value is emitted from that observable, it will
    gracefully close the subscription is is applied to.
  </p>

  <code class="block javascript">
    <pre>
export class TakeUntilComponent implements OnDestroy {
  // Our magical observable that will be passed to takeUntil()
  private readonly ngUnsubscribe$: Subject&lt;void&gt; = new Subject&lt;void&gt;();

  // Our subject that we will subscribe to
  subjectA$: Subject&lt;number&gt; = new Subject&lt;number&gt;();

  constructor() {
    this.subjectA$
      .pipe(takeUntil(this.ngUnsubscribe$))
      .subscribe(value => {
      // logic goes here ...
    });
  }

  ngOnDestroy(){
    // Emit a value so that takeUntil will handle the closing of our subscriptions;
    this.ngUnsubscribe$.next();
    // Unsubscribe from our unsubscriber to avoid creating a memory leak
    this.ngUnsubscribe$.unsubscribe();
  }

}
</pre>
  </code>

  <p>
    Hopefully you learned something new here! I am by no means an expert but I
    write this hoping you can skip the first 3 itterations of learning and
    jump straight into the best pattern to work with (best being my opinion
    ofcourse). If you know of a better pattern or solution, or if there are
    any issues with what I have written above, please let me know!
