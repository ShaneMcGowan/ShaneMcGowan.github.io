Hello, its been a long time since I've written a blog. Since then I have started and closed a company, changed jobs twice and had a mental breakdown but we are now back on track.
And being back on track, what better a thing to do than get obsessed with a new project. Creating a game engine in TypeScript and HTML5 Canvas.

# Why make a game using web technologies?
Why make a game using web technologies? This is a great question. I wanted to create a game from scratch with little to no dependencies. This project uses only typescript and webpack as dependencies and honestly those are only for convenience. This could have been achieved without webpack and using just Vanilla JavaScript but that would have been much more tedious. While I'm not a JavaScript purist, I hate the current situation of NPM and dependency hell. I wanted to create something as self contained as possible.

Would using an already existing game engine be easier? Yes
Would using a different language more equipped for the task such as C# or C++ have been a better idea? Yes
Would either of those have been as much fun? No
Do I care what the correct way to do things is? No

This project was to have fun and learn, and to better myself as a developer.

This all initially started as an attempt to recreate Pokemon Red as an in browser MMO from scratch, and while I had some success, the code quickly became a mess and each additional feature became a pain to implement.

That project was left to the side until heroku killed their free hosting tier and is no longer available.
my friends and I had some fun in it while it was working with one friend even making this very wholesome meme (I cant share the other ones they made because they arent very safe for work) but this project was eventually abandonded.

that projext became the basis for my new engine. 
taking everything tjay i had learned about HTML5 canvas and game development, as well as some brief wxperienxe with Unity before they became really shit with their licensing and a short stint mesaing about with s&box, i decided to create a proper engine for 2D pixel art games.
