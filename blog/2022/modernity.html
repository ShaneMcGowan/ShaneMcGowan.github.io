Modernity
I have all that I could possibly want yet it does not scratch the itch, that feeling inside that is always wanting something more. What do you get the man who has everything and feels nothing? Is our attention oversubscribed? Are our senses slowly numbed due to over stimulation? Sleep evades me yet my waking hours are filled with day dreaming of dreams. All I want is free time and when I get it all I want is to work. An idle mind spirals into thoughts of the void yet a frantic mind points to the desire of an idle mind. No control over oneâ€™s ability to regain control. I once wanted everything but now I want nothing. Leave me be, in silence, and perhaps my own mind will finally leave me be.
