  <h1>My problem with sleep</h1>
  <p>
    I am currently struggling to sleep so I thought why not talk some shite about sleep.
  </p>


  As the song "Lucky, Lucky, Lucky Me" by Evelyn Knight goes
  <i>
    <p>
      Lucky, lucky, lucky me!
      </br>
      I'm a lucky son of a gun.
      </br>
      I work eight hours, and sleep eight hours,
      </br>
      That leaves eight hours for fun
    </p>
  </i>

  Your average person spends 8 hours per day working per day, 8 hours of "free" time, and 8 hours of sleep. (most of us
  know we don't get enough sleep but go with it for the sake of my ramblings)

  This would suggest that as humans, we are living on a ratio of, for every 2 hours awake, we must spend 1 hour asleep.
  2:1 awake vs asleep.

  Work in modern society goes along with this, with the idea of a traditional 9 to 5 job. 8 Hours of work.
  We then have from 5pm until 1am for leisure. 8 hours of fun.
  Then sleep from 1am until 9am. 8 hours of sleep.

  Ignoring those who work irregular hours etc, this is the agreed upon standard way of living for most of us.
  Anyone who deviates from this will find it difficult to make plans with those who live by this standard. (picture 2
  Nurses in love but one works the day shift and the other works the night shift, heart breaking isn't it but such is
  life)

  <h2>The Energy Dilema</h2>
  <p>
    We wake up each morning and then give the most energetic hours of our day to working. Provided you aren't self
    employed, one could argue that this is a disservice to yourself. Why live your life 5 days a week running on fumes
    when you can let a corporation have those fumes instead, while you enjoy your precious energy all for yourself.
  </p>
  <p>
    This can be achieved via working remotely for a company in a different time zone. The time difference can allow you
    to wake up at 9am local time. Spend 8 hours for yourself on living your life, then at 5pm, clock in for 8 hours of
    your remote job.
    For example, waking up at 9am in Ireland, enjoying your day, then at 5pm, logging on to your remote job for a
    California based company where it is now 9am California time. Then go to bed straight away at 1am when you log off.
  </p>
  <p>
    You never agreed to give these corporations your <strong>first</strong> 8 hours of your day, you agree to simply 8
    hours per day.
  </p>

  <h2>The Problem With 8 Hours Of Sleep.</h2>
  <p>
    The problem with 8 hours of sleep arises at the point where 8 hours contains 480 minutes, but the average sleep
    cycle lasts between <a
      href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526132/#:~:text=Approximately%2075%25%20of%20sleep%20is,roughly%2090%20to%20110%20minutes.">roughly
      90 to 110 minutes</a>.
    This means that in an 8 hour range, we are getting anywhere between 4.36 to 5.33 sleep cycles. These incomplete
    sleep cycles are wildly inefficient and are where the root of my issue lies.
    Research also indicates that the different stages of sleep, while all important, last for different lengths of time
    the more cycles deep you are into a single sleeping session, with Deep Sleep (the most important one for recovery),
    lessening each cycle.
    This means that the second half of our 8 hour sleeping session is also wildly inefficient in terms of Deep Sleep.
    We are wasting precious hours sleeping that we could be spending sleeping except better.

      aren't biased)</figcaption>

  <h2>Sleep Smarter, Not Longer</h2>
  <p>
    Each person subscribed to the 8:8:8 sleep:work:fun pattern of living has one thing in common, they are surviving on
    8
    hours of sleep.
    But, each person is unique, so what if we could calculate <strong>exactly</strong> how much sleep someone needed to
    go about their day, and how to sleep most efficiently. Not every person is going to require an awake to sleep ration
    of 2:1 to survive.
    Some may require more sleep, some may need less sleep. Quality of life could be improved greatly if this were to be
    figured out.
  </p>
  <p>
    We already know that the average person is having between 4.36 to 5.33 sleep cycles per 8 hour sleeping session with
    Deep Sleep becoming less frequent during the latter half of this.
    We could create a unique sleep plan for maximum deep sleep gained per person to the extent required for them to
    function in their day to day life by getting the following information:
  <ul>
    <li>Their average sleep cycle length</li>
    <li>Their true sleep hours to awake hours ratio requirements</li>
  </ul>
  If we combine this information with additional information on the stages of sleep that provide the most recovery, we
  could create a formula to provide the optimal sleep cycle for a person.
  </p>

  <h2>Rejecting Modernity</h2>
  <p>
    Armed with our above sleeping algorithm, we are no longer bound to the 2:1 awake:sleep ratio, meaning we can now
    optimise our life for peek energy.
    We can create a new pattern, that suits ourself.
  </p>
  <p>
    Assuming a lucky person with a 90 minute sleep cycle.
  </p>
  <strong>09:00</strong> Work
  </br>
  <strong>13:00</strong> 1 Sleep Cyle
  </br>
  <strong>14:30</strong> Work
  </br>
  <strong>18:30</strong> Leisure
  </br>
  <strong>21:00</strong> 1 Sleep Cycle
  </br>
  <strong>22:30</strong> Leisure
  </br>
  <strong>03:00</strong> 2 Sleep Cycles
  </br>
  <strong>09:00</strong> Work.
  <p>
    In the above scenario, the person has gotten 4 periods of maximum effictiveness Deep Sleep in 6 hours, rather than 8
    hours of slowly decreasing effectiveness Deep Sleep, providing 2 additional hours to their day with theoretically
    the same, if not more, energy.
    Combine this with what was discussed above in <strong>The Energy Dilema</strong>, this theorectical person would
    have 10 energy filled hours of Leisure time per work day.
  </p>

  <h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
  <p>
    While this all may in reality be nonesense, I feel we are slowly approaching a period where each person will be able
    to gain much more personalised health and wellness care thanks to advancements in technology, particularly AI.
    We only have a limited time on this earth and we spend a huge 33% of that asleep and I feel we could optimise this
    so we may even only need to spend 25% of our time asleep, giving us an extra 8% of our time to enjoy being enslaved
    under out future AI overlords.
